    <h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
    <p>Week 1 
        January 3-6
        
        My first week as ASU Open Scholarship intern! This is the type of work I have been excited to do since before I started my MLIS degree! I am very excited to do this type of work with this team! This is my first opportunity to really put my MLIS to work in an academic library setting, and I am looking forward to doing a lot of cool work and meeting people through this internship. This week was mostly getting set up for the quarter. Anali and I met to discuss the learning outcomes agreement and talk about what projects I would be working on this quarter. I adjusted my hours and dropped my DFW down to 100 hours so I will be doing 10 hours of work per week and then finishing my internship on the ASU semester system with deliverables outside of DFW set deliverables. Looking forward to having more of a routine with regular meetings and hours.

    <p> Week 2
        January 9-13
        
        This week I had my first task of moving links from the March Mammal Madness (MMM) library guide to a collaborative spreadsheet for evaluating what resources to include in the next iteration of the MMM library guide. I met with all the library interns to get us oriented to ASUâ€™s systems and get set up using Slack. Allison discussed what professional development opportunities we will have throughout the course of our internship. I also met with the Open Scholarship team which consists of me, my supervisor Anali, Matthew, and another intern Emily. We went over onboarding materials, expectations, and how often me and Emily would work on blog posts for Library research news. I set up a repository on github for posting deliverables and reflections.</p>
