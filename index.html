    <h3>bio</h3>
    My name is Abbie Thacher and I am earning my Master degree in library and information science at the University of Washington in Seattle. As my capstone project, I am working with librarians and staff at UW to make research tools and library instruction more accessible to neurodivergent students. I am an Open Science and Scholarly Communication Intern at Arizona State University. I decided to get my MLIS because I love research and I think there is a lot of interesting research being done, but finding it and reading it is so hard especially outside of a university setting. 
</p>
<p> Outside of academic librarianship, I love reading and writing poetry, going to museums, and listening to pop music!</p>
